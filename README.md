This is a test version of a fruit dryer machine.
In Faze1 of this project we connected temperature and humid sensor to an Arduino UNO discovery board, and some fans and elements using SSD rlays.
and we also have a LCD character and rotary encoder to control and set the temp and humid limitations and display the sensors amounts.
